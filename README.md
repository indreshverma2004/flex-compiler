Design a custom instruction for a given equation in compiler.

This project implements a Lex/Flex-based lexical analyzer that processes mathematical expressions and computes results using custom-defined instructions for AI/ML workloads. The program recognizes variables (xN, yN), mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, =), and the keyword "compute" to execute the equation: z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) . It is a standard formula from geometry â€” specifically, it's the distance formula in 2D space from the origin (0, 0) to the point (x3, y4).
